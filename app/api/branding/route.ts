"Boldness for innovation," "the dynamic nature of travel," and "intelligence in understanding the present and future needs of both customers and the industry" are essential in crafting these experiences. These elements help solidify Alibaba's position as the leading brand in the travel industry, setting it apart from competitors while continuously creating value to meet diverse customer needs.
Innovation, shaping the future, being a pioneer, and adapting to modern audience behavior patterns are the key themes that have guided us in redefining Alibaba’s brand identity.`;

        The pink Pokémon, however, appeared among some users due to unforeseen bugs such as the Dealer bug. 
        It was therefore perceived by the public as a secret character, fueling many myths and rumors. 
        This is why, and to the surprise of the development team, Satoshi Tajiri decided to expose Mew 
        in the Japanese magazine CoroCoro Comics in the spring of 1996 and to launch the 
        "Legendary Pokémon Offer" contest in April: twenty winners were to be selected to receive Mew.

            In designing the Alibaba monogram, we have designed a firm and decisive form, considering the brand identity and strategy, which, while being solid, is distanced from stillness and staticity by the movement of the curve in the middle of the letter A and is in harmony with the vibrant atmosphere of travel.

            We have designed this monogram dynamically; meaning that it has a fixed DNA and anatomy; But its appearance is variable and changes in brand communications depending on what message is to be conveyed to which audience through which medium. This approach is a bold strategy in design and allows the brand to respond intelligently to social situations and audience needs, and at the communication level, always be one step ahead of customer expectations.
